# 👋 About Me:

**Building CredX.AI | Software Engineer | MS CS'25 @ UF 🐊 | Go | Next.js | AWS**

I am a passionate Software Engineer driven by the challenge of building scalable, secure, and reliable systems. Currently, I serve as the founding **Full Stack Developer at CredX.AI**, a FinTech startup, where I am architecting and building a million-dollar Finance SaaS product from the ground up. In this high-stakes environment, I own the entire web-app engineering lifecycle. This involves making critical decisions regarding Backend Architecture, DB schema design, Authentication parameters, API Response structure, cloud Deployment Strategies, and security protocols to ensure the platform handles sensitive financial data reliably.

I actively bridge the gap between traditional software engineering and modern AI capabilities, integrating LLMs and prompt engineering to enhance user experience. Previously, I earned my **M.S. in Computer Science** from the University of Florida (GPA 3.76), where I received the Achievement Award Grant from the Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering.

I am looking for the next opportunity to apply my expertise in distributed systems, backend performance, and AI integration to teams tackling complex technical challenges at scale.
